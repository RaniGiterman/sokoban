# Sokoban Game and Reinforcement Learning Model Implmementation

- This project was created for 5unit/full bagrut in Machine Learning.
- It implements a sokoban game and a reinforcement learning model to solve it. Jupyter notebook: `jupyter_notebook.ipynb`
- I wrote a full book explaining the project, the code and everything you need to know about it: `book.pdf`
- There is also my presentation slides: `presentation.pdf`
- Images for the game: `images/`, containing the boxes and player images.
